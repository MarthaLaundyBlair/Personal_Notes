# Initial Ideas:

## Possible Domain Names:

For happy buttons idea:

- [happymap.app](https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=happymap) £21.90

- [happymap.uk](https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=happymap) £9

- [moodbuttons.com](https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=moodbuttons) £12.50


- [happymaps.app](https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=happy%20maps) £21.90

- [thehappinessproject.uk](https://iwantmyname.com/?domain=thehappinessproject) £9

For calculator idea:

- ulator.world

## Happy Maps:

### Data to collect:
- Happiness rating (sad, neutral, happy)
- Location: initially could just manually input location eg. city which could then be
recorded and displayed (potentially still on map)
- Quantising maps into large regions (counties perhaps initially) which could then be colored
based on happiness score could be a simple prototype
- Later on would be great if could link to gps and drop pin on a map

### Format of webpage:
- Three buttons that can be interacted with (sad, neutral, happy)
- Map that displays collected happiness scores
- Initially could display happiness buttons and then once rating has been submitted could take you
to the map
- Can start with just UK or even just Darlington and work way up to bigger maps
- Later would be cool to introduce a search function on the map and a way of viewing it independent
of giving ratings
- Initially think that happiness data should all be stored and used to create an average score per area
but later it would be good to introduce temporary pins and stuff

### Things to do:
- Create the webpage.
- Add 3 buttons and collect a different stored value when each button is pressed.
- Add a way of inputting loction (county or town etc.). This would require a quantised list of places which 
a user inputted value could be compared to.
- Write a function that uses the collected 'happiness scores' to assign each place a happiness ranking
- Create a quantised map split into the locations preveiously listed
- Write a function that changes the colour of each location dependent on happiness ranking (red=happy/blue=sad)
- *Literally have no idea how to create quantised map and if I'm even thinking about it in the right way*


## Simple Calculator:
- Could be a much simpler initial project to get me in the mood
- Start with something simple like a cubic equation and then perhaps simple differential equations (eg. constant coefficients)

### Things to do:
- Display some text
- Add a way of inputting equation coefficients and storing them
- Write a function(s) that solve desired equation(s)
- Output solution
- Later could add an option to initially select which type of equation to be solved (drop down list)
